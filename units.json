    "description": "Computers are everywhere and in nearly everything - the watch you wear, the phone you use, the car you drive, the games you play and, increasingly, in your home. CITS140 I is the first step along your path to being able to use computers to solve problems. Because computers cannot yet work using human languages, computer languages have been devised to allow algorithms encoding solutions to problems to be executed on computers. In this unit you will learn about, and use, the very popular language Python 3. Along the way you will also learn some problem solving techniques and how to create algorithms; you will also learn how computers execute your programs",

    "description": "Understanding the relationship between a programming language and the contemporary operating systems on which it executes is central to developing many skills in Computer Science. This unit introduces the standard C programming language, on which many other programming languages and systems are based, through a study of core operating system services including input and output, memory management and file systems. The C language is introduced through discussions on basic topics like data types, variables, expressions, control structures, scoping rules, functions and parameter passing. More advanced topics like C's run-time environment, system calls, dynamic memory allocation, pointers and recursion are presented in the context of operating system services related to process execution, memory management and file systems. The importance of process scheduling, memory management and interprocess communication in modern operating systems is discussed in the context of operating system support for multiprogramming. Laboratory and practical class work place a strong focus on the practical application of fundamental programming concepts, with examples designed to compare and contrast many key features of contemporary operating systems.",
